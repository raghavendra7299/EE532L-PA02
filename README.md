# EE532L Deep Learning for Healthcare - Programming Assignment 02

## Report
Accuracy: 0.75974

Observations: The test accuracy of the model using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction is lower compared to the model without PCA. This indicates that the reduced-dimensional representation of the features obtained through PCA may not capture all the relevant information for accurate classification as effectively as using the original features directly.

## About
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is a widely used dataset in machine learning, particularly for binary classification tasks related to diabetes prediction. The dataset consists of 768 instances. There are 8 numeric predictive attributes. The attributes are as follows:
 - Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
 - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 - BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 - SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 - Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
 - Age: Age in years

The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not. It takes the values 0 (no diabetes) or 1 (diabetes). Now your goal is to build a predictive model using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the given attributes. Please pay attention to the comments of the Python file pa02.py. Please fill in the code snippets wherever necessary. 


## Instructions
  - Make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  - Please accept this invite (shared in the Google Classroom) for the GitHub Classroom.
  - Once you accept the assignment invitation, you will be redirected to your assignment repository on GitHub.
  - You're supposed to only change the sections where you are allowed to do so in the pa02.py script.
  - Then upload or commit and push the changes to your assignment repo.
  - Your assignment will be automatically graded, otherwise, you will receive an email that the auto-grading has failed then make sure the code has no errors.
